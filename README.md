# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
     
     The purpose of this analysis was to make a dataset that compiled a clientâ€™s stock market data.
Although the code worked, this project specifically will further improve the code for the client by 
refactoring the code.  


## Results

### Previous Sample Code and Timed Results.
'5) loop through rows in the data
       
       Sheets(yearValue).Activate
       For j = 2 To RowCount
          
          '5a) Get total volume for current ticker
           If Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
               totalVolume = totalVolume + Cells(j, 8).Value
           End If
           
           '5b) get starting price for current ticker
           If Cells(j - 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then

               startingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
           End If
  
  '5c) get ending price for current ticker
           
           If Cells(j + 1, 1).Value <> ticker And Cells(j, 1).Value = ticker Then
               endingPrice = Cells(j, 6).Value
           End If

### Refactored Sample Code And Timed Results 

'1a) Create a ticker Index
    
    tickerIndex = 0

    '1b) Create three output arrays

    Dim tickerVolumes(12) As Long
    Dim tickerStartingPrices(12) As Single
    Dim tickerEndingPrices(12) As Single
    
'2a) Create a for loop to initialize the tickerVolumes to zero
    
    For i = 0 To 11
    tickerVolumes(i) = 0
    Next i
   
 '2b) Loop over all the rows in the spreadsheet.
    
    Worksheets(yearValue).Activate
    
    For i = 2 To RowCount
        '3a) Increase volume for current ticker
       
       tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) = tickerVolumes(tickerIndex) + Cells(i, 8).Value
        
'3b) Check if the current row is the first row with the selected tickerIndex.
       
       If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerStartingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
     
        End If
       
 '3c) check if the current row is the last row with the selected ticker
         
         'If the next row's ticker doesn't match, increase the tickerIndex.
        If Cells(i, 1).Value = tickers(tickerIndex) And Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> tickers(tickerIndex) Then
        tickerEndingPrices(tickerIndex) = Cells(i, 6).Value
        End If
           
 '3d) Increase the tickerIndex.
            
            If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then
            tickerIndex = tickerIndex + 1
            
            End If

## Summary
       
     The refactor code ran faster by using more output arays and nested loops. 
This can be advantages for many different stock analysis, but if the data was more complicated, 
it would be better to run it the 1st way. Ran into a few errors in the code, 
but it was an easy fix since the code was shorter. VBA doesn't have a good debug system so my opinion would to leave more arays for other coding programs.
